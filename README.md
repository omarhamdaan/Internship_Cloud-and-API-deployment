# AWS EC2 Flask App Deployment

This repository contains all the necessary files for deploying a digit recognizer Flask application on AWS EC2. The application uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits. 
## Project Structure

- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for the Flask app.
- `9.png`: An example image of a digit used for testing the application.
- `AWS Output EC2 digit recognizer.png`: Screenshot showing the output of the digit recognizer on AWS EC2.
- `AWS Website HomePage EC2.png`: Screenshot of the Flask app home page when deployed on AWS EC2.
- `Digit_Recognizer_CNN.py`: The script used to train the CNN model.
- `FlaskAPP.py`: The main Flask application script.
- `Internship_Cloud and API deployment_Report.pdf`: A report detailing the process and learnings from deploying the Flask app on AWS EC2.
- `mnist_classification.h5`: The trained model saved in HDF5 format.
- `requirement.txt`: A list of Python packages required to run the Flask app.
